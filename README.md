# Invoice Automation
Mass invoice generation and automation tool

## Project Background
In many businesses, invoice generation is a critical but often time-consuming task, especially when handling a large volume of customer transactions. Manual processing not only increases the risk of errors but also leads to significant inefficiencies in operations.

To address these challenges, this project was developed to automate the invoice generation process. By streamlining data integration and automating invoice creation, companies can reduce manual workload, minimize errors, and improve overall operational efficiency.

## Project Goal
This project aims to automate the generation of company invoices in PDF by using **Python Jupyter Notebook** and **Microsoft Excel**. It is designed to process large-scale customer sales data efficiently, ensuring accurate, consistent, and scalable invoice creation with minimal manual intervention.
